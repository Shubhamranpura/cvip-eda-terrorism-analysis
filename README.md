Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Global Terrorism Dataset

Introduction:

This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist activities worldwide. Additionally, some data has been added to focus on terrorism activities in India.

Project Description:

The project utilizes Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy to perform EDA on the GTD. It includes the following analyses:

Temporal Analysis: Visualizes the timeline of terrorist attacks and casualties.

Geospatial Analysis: Investigates global and regional patterns of terrorism using maps and charts.

Categorical Analysis: Explores categorical variables such as attack types, target types, and terrorist groups.

Casualty Analysis: Examines casualties caused by terrorist activities.

Country and City Analysis: Focuses on terrorism in India and analyzes data for Indian cities.

Group Analysis: Investigates the most active terrorist groups and their impact.

Results:

The project uncovers valuable insights into global terrorism trends, highlighting regions, attack types, and groups with the highest impact. Additionally, it provides specific insights into terrorism activities in India.

Conclusion:

This EDA serves as a foundation for deeper research into counter-terrorism strategies and informed decision-making by governments and organizations worldwide.

Note:

Some data related to terrorism activities in India has been added to enrich the analysis and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
